        and calendar service developed by 37signals, the company behind Basecamp.
        Here are some key features of HEY:\\n\\n- **Control Over Inbox**: HEY allows
        users to screen emails from new senders, similar to screening calls, giving
        users complete control over who can reach their inbox.\\n- **Organized Inbox**:
        Emails are grouped with new messages at the top and previously seen emails
        at the bottom, making the inbox more organized.\\n- **Effortless Reading**:
        Users can open multiple emails at once and scroll through them like a newsfeed,
        improving efficiency.\\n- **Attachment Library**: All attachments are collected
        in one organized place, making it easier to find files without searching through
        individual emails.\\n- **Set Aside and Reply Later**: Users can set aside
        emails for later reference and use the \\\"Reply Later\\\" feature to manage
        emails that need responses at a later time.\\n- **Privacy and Security**:
        HEY blocks spy trackers and does not collect user data, providing strong privacy
        protections.\\n- **Subscription Model**: HEY operates on a subscription model,
        which allows it to maintain an ethical business model without relying on ads
        or data sales.\\n\\n## General Usage of \\\"Hey\\\"\\nApart from the email
        service, \\\"hey\\\" is a common interjection used in various ways:\\n- To
        call attention or express interrogation, surprise, or exultation.\\n- As an
        informal greeting.\\n- To indicate that one is not bothered or troubled by
        something.\"}, \"delta\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \" something.\"}}]}\r\n\r\ndata:
